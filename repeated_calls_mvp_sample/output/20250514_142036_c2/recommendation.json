    "issue_summary": "Customer's HedgeBot Compact won't turn on.",
    "reasoning": "The current call is not considered a repeat call because it concerns a specific operational issue with the customer's HedgeBot Compact device, whereas the previous call was about a promotional inquiry regarding a different product, the Aquaspray X. The nature of the issues, the described call reasons, and the details of the respective interactions are entirely distinct, and they are not related to the same problem. Additionally, the resolved status of the earlier call further suggests it was independently addressed and not part of an ongoing concern."
