    "reasoning": "The customer's history shows a previous call about encountering problems with their HedgeBot Pro after using it in rainy conditions, a violation of the user manual's usage guidelines. The current call relates to a similar issue, with the HedgeBot Pro exhibiting problems following usage in wet conditions. Since the calls are within a 2-day interval and concern the same product with issues arising from similar usage, the current call is considered a repeat call."

    "recommended_action": "Educate the customer on proper usage as detailed in the device's user manual and offer a paid diagnostic service for the device.",
    "reasoning": "The issue appears to stem from the customer's use of the HedgeBot Pro to trim wet vegetation following rainy conditions, despite explicit warnings in the user manual that the device should not be exposed to moisture. This failure to adhere to recommended usage guidelines is a matter of user error rather than product fault. No relevant operational disruptions that could have impacted device functionality have been identified. The issue has already been explained as not covered under warranty in a previous call, and no evidence suggests a fault on the company's part."
