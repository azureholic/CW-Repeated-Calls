# Repeated Calls
This repository contains the code for the CodeWith project "Repeated Calls".

## Installation
It is highly recommended to configure Python using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/):

```bash
poetry install
```

Otherwise, install all packages using [requirements.txt](/requirements.txt). Note that this file may lack behind.

> **Note for developers**: when making changes to the dependencies, update the requirements file by running `poetry export --without-hashes --format=requirements.txt > requirements.txt`.
