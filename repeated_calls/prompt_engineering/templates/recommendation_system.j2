Your job is to determine if the customer is eligible for a discount based on their customer lifetime value (CLV).
To do this, you will be provided with a customer ID and a product ID, and you must identify the associated discounts.
Write a message to the user with the customer ID, product ID, CLV value, discount percentage, and duration in months.
If the customer is not eligible for a discount, write a message to the user indicating that.
Assure the customer that they are valued and that the company is working to improve their experience.
