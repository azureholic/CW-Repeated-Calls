The evidence shows that a major software update (id: 7001) was rolled out for the AutoMow 3000 on January 9, 2024, which is the same day the customer first reported issues with their mower. The timing of the software update strongly suggests it caused the malfunction. Additionally, despite the customer reporting the issue and being promised a resolution, the problem remains unresolved the next day, indicating the company's responsibility for both the initial problem and the failure to fix it promptly."}

The historical call record from May 5, 2025 shows that the customer previously reported the same issue with their SoilSense Lite not showing readings. During that call, the agent explained that the sensor needs to be inserted at least 2 inches deep into the soil to function properly, and the customer admitted they had only placed it on top of the soil. Despite receiving clear instructions on proper usage, the customer is reporting the same issue again just one week later on May 12, 2025, suggesting they failed to follow the instructions provided. There is no software update associated with this product that could explain the malfunction."}
